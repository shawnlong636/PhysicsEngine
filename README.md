## PhysicsEngine

This project follows along with Ian Millington's [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768) and is is meant to serve as a demonstration of core understanding. This engine is written in C++, built with CMake and tested using gtest.
